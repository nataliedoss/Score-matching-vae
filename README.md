# Score-matching-vae

This is a TensorFlow implementation of the algorithm described in Section 5.3 of <a href="https://github.com/nataliedoss/Thesis/blob/master/main.pdf" download>Chapter 5: Nonparametric variational inference via score matching</a>. This algorithm imitates the variational autoencoder of [Kingma and Welling (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114), but performs variational inference by minimizing the Fisher divergence rather than the KL divergence. It is provided in a Jupyter notebook, [Variational autoencoder via score matching](https://github.com/nataliedoss/Score-matching-vae/blob/master/vae_sm.ipynb)

Also included is a Jupyter notebook, [Variational autoencoder via ratio matching](https://github.com/nataliedoss/Score-matching-vae/blob/master/vae_rm.ipynb), implementing the ratio-matching algorithm described in Section 5.3. Again, this algorithm imitates the variational autoencoder, but performs variational inference via ratio matching rather than by minimizing the KL divergence.
